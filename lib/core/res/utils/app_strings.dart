      'All AR INSTRUMED products are warranted to be free from defects in workmanship and materials. Should any product demonstrate defects in workmanship or materials, it will be repaired or replaced at no cost. However, the customer shall bear the additional shipping charges associated with the use of the AR INSTRUMED Courier return labels and the shipment back to the customer, as indicated on the invoice.\n\nRegarding staining of the instruments, it is important to note that staining is a surface deposit that is often mistaken for rust. While it is rare for instruments to rust, staining may occur after autoclaving. Stains can appear in various colors, which can indicate the origin of the stain. We provide suggestions on how to avoid staining in the instrument care sections of the AR INSTRUMED website and catalog.\n\nThis warranty does not cover normal wear and tear or the use of instruments beyond their intended limitations. Additionally, it excludes the improper usage of an instrument, wherein it is used in a manner inconsistent with its intended design and purpose. Furthermore, instruments that have been damaged through abusive or accidental means are not covered by this warranty.\n\nIt is important to adhere to proper storage and sterilization procedures as outlined in the Instrument Care sections of the AR INSTRUMED website and catalog. Failure to store and sterilize the instruments correctly may void the warranty. Additionally, any modifications, alterations, or sharpening performed on AR INSTRUMED instruments will result in the revocation of the warranty.';
